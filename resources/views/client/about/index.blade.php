                        <p>
                            Founder and Chief Group Executive of Elite FX
                            started his entrepreneurial life at a young age.
                            Our philosophy of ‘Providing Personalised
                            Solutions’ has always been the core principle of
                            all his business dealings. Elite FX Signals
                            realises that although two completely different
                            individuals who may both harbour the same
                            business and investment ideas will fall pray to
                            an outcome of success or failure based upon its
                            execution.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With this in mind, a couple of years ago, our
                            working life came to a deliberate halt when we
                            decided that ‘Investment’ was the way forward.
                            Work smart not hard !
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Elite FX founder plunged into the world of
                            Forex and followed many different mentors with
                            different coaching abilities quickly realising
                            that no two students absorbed information the
                            same way or traded the same. You are a unique
                            individual in your own right so why would you
                            imitate someone when you could achieve success
                            and still be you?

                Ricky commenced his venture by creating the Elite FX brand,
                who now also own and operate the Elite FX Training Academy
                and Elite FX Robot Trader. To think all this started with a
                small investment amount, perseverance and determination
                which quickly became second nature until the investment both
                in his knowledge and monetary value grew exponentially.

                        <p>
                            Hello, my name is Yannis Sfairopoulos, I was
                            born in Greece, but grew up and studied in
                            France.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I am a pationate self-employed software
                            engineer, and IT manager for a Greek high-tech
                            company, and I have also been teaching Computer
                            Science for many years in Colleges in Greece.
                            About 20 years ago, a friend of mine guided me
                            and mentored me through the maze, but amazing
                            world of Currency trading, and for me, it was
                            love at first sight.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Trading became a passion and a vision because it
                            combines for me the best of 2 beloved worlds,
                            applying algorithms to create automated and
                            semi-automated trading systems and tools for
                            traders, and teaching and guiding new traders,
                            giving them the knowledge and the resources to
                            become successfull in this unforgiving yet
                            highly attractive and lucrative market.

                achieve, at 20 years of age, no mortgage, no kids and no
